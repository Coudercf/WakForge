This is the repository for WakForge, coded by Fryke (fryke) on Discord.
<!-- Come check out the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Vafdx5JWBh). -->

WakForge is a character build tool for the game Wakfu. This README will be updated with current features as the project is upgraded and added to.

You can find the site at <https://wakforge.org>.<br>
<!-- You can find the standalone Electron version in the [releases section](https://github.com/Tmktahu/atlas/releases). -->

## Features

- Complete character builder including characteristics, items, sublimations, and runes.
- Powerful, dynamic live item filtering capabilities.
- Locally stored information with no backend server. Leverages JSON files and LocalStorage for persistance.
- Import, export, and share character builds via JSON files.

## Locally Stored Information?

All character and program data is stored locally on your computer in the form of JSON data.

The data is saved to the [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) of your web browser. This allows your changes to persist through refreshes and sessions.

You are able to import and export your character data as JSON files as you see fit. This is how you would share your character data with other people.

## Google Analytics

Unfortunately Github Pages doesn't provide deployment traffic information, so I use Google Analytics to collect basic usage data so I can tell if people are actually using WakForge. This lets me keep an eye on site traffic and gives me a source of motivation to continue developing the app. If this doesn't sit well with you, any basic ad-blocker will successfully stop Google Analytics in its tracks.

If you do use an ad-blocker, I would greatly appreciate it if you would consider giving this repository a star or hop in the discord and let me know that you use WakForge. The more I hear about people using this tool, the more I'll want to make it better.
